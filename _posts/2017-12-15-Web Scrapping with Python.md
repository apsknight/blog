Internet has superabundant information and knowledge but to extract that knowledge in organised, scalable and systemetic way for data analysis and other research purpose is known as [Web Scrapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping). 

Web Scrapping automatically extracts the data from a particular website and present it in user desired form. We can scrap many things from the web like Stock updates, Price of any product from Amazon. In this post I'll scrap news updates from my [college's website](http://www.iitbbs.ac.in).  

## Getting Started
We can use almost any scripting language for web scrapping however the popular options are Javascript and Python. Both Javascript and Python have rich set of scrapping libraries like [CheerioJS](https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio) for Javascript and [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org), [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) for Python.  

I'll use Python and BeautifulSoup for this post because both Python and BeautifulSoup are beginner friendly.
* For Mac and Linux users, Python is preinstalled.
* Windows users can install Python from [official website](https://python.org).

For installing BeautifulSoup library, simply enter following command in terminal.
```bash
pip install beautifulsoup4
```  

## Finding Target from HTML
All the news & updates of IIT Bhubaneswar are enlisted on [this](http://www.iitbbs.ac.in/news.php) webpage. Visit this Webpage and press `Ctr + Shift + I` to inspect source code of the webpage. Now click on the the mouse button present on the top-left part of inspector panel and hover over list of news updates. We can see in inspector panel that all news and updates of that webpage are inside an unordered list with class *rectlist*.
```html
<ol class="rectlist">
```

Thus we have to scrap all list items present in aforementioned unordered list.

## Writing script for scrapping

<script src="https://gist.github.com/apsknight/26aa99f3d2633aaf6e216bb7fc2bf058.js"></script>

After running this script we'll get required result in terminal.

**Update:** I recently came to know another very good resource(<https://likegeeks.com/python-web-scraping>) for Web Scrapping. I think you may also like it.

**Warning:** Scrapping data from certain website may violate their Terms and Conditions or Privacy Policy. Please check such things before deploying any scrapper. Most of the websites also have a file named *robots.txt* on their server which lists all such webpages that shouldn't be crawled so check for such files before scrapping from any site. For e.g. robot.txt file of Google is present on this <a href="https://www.google.co.in/robots.txt" target="_blank">link</a>.
