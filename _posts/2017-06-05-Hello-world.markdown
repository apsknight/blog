Bonjour! So after 3 countiguous hours, I'm finally done with setting up this blog with *Jekyll*. At first glance it was perplexing but as I dived deep into documentation of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/) everything sorted out. I have also plugged in [DISQUS](https://disqus.com/) in the blog so that visitor can engage and express on this blog.

### What is Jekyll ?
Quoting from Jekyll Documentation:
>Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through a converter (like Markdown) and our Liquid renderer, and spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable for serving with your favorite web server. Jekyll also happens to be the engine behind GitHub Pages, which means you can use Jekyll to host your project’s page, blog, or website from GitHub’s servers for free.


Basically, Jekyll is a technology built with [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) which help in publishing static site without a backend. Most blogs on web are powered by content management system like Wordpress, Drupal etc. The limitation of such blogs is that they need a 24*7 running backend server hosted either locally or on some hosting services like Hostgator, GoDaddy, Amazon AWS etc. on the other hand Jekyll provide us an option to eliminate the backend and build static blog posts that can be hosted on **Github Pages**. So in layman's term Jekyll is a technology which can be used to render static HTML without need of any backend server.

So this is all guys. I'll keep writing here. Don't forget to bookmark my blog and keep visiting frequently. Bonne journee!
